# ReactTakeawayChallenge

## The functionality of the App is very simple, it's counts witha Home page that render popular movies / user search movies / filter by rating both topics and also search movies by rating only.

## For this project I used TMDB Api in order to get the movies data and a library for the rating component.


## For try it out just

```
git clone repo
npx install or yarn install
npx expo start or yarn expo start
```
